<s>Lazy</s> Good Coders Automate Everything

I have an aversion to any sort of repetitive task. I generally start to worry that I will not repeat the task in exactly the same way, resulting in minor variations from the procedure. Inconsistency bothers me. That probably says a lot about me. Probably more than I should be telling...

So after a couple of iterations of anything I will try to find a way to script it or automate it in some way.

After writing two blog posts about my automated writing workflow, I realised that my blogging was very repetitive. Typical!

So I applied the same logic to the blogging that I had applied to the writing and came up with this

{% gist wsinned/fa635d1ba5c333a33352 %}

### Conclusion

Now I have a nifty  method of getting a new post up and running.

{% highlight Bash %}
~ new-post my-post-title
{% endhighlight %}
