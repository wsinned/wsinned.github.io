I recently followed up on a recommendation to read [Artful Making by Robert Austin and Lee Devin](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0130086959/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0130086959&linkCode=as2&tag=notetoself01-21&linkId=CMU3YA47YIU2VQZH).

The book examines the process of 'Artful Making' from the point of view of a theatre company, and the iterative approach they have to delivering a product (a production of a play) correctly, on budget and on time, time and time again. This approach is then contrasted to 'Industrial Making' using the traditional waterfall method of big design up front.

While delivering a software product was always seen as a prime candidate for the waterfall method, the agile approach outlined in the book is very familiar to us now. This book was first published in 2003, but is still extremely relevant as an example of why we should be using agile methodologies, and how we should think about agile when we apply it to software. 

It is also made clear that the 'artistic' side of innovation is not something that can be planned, but it is something that can be managed effectively by creating an environment where it can flourish. By allowing iterations that may not produce a viable improvement in the product, but do provide a fertile ground for learning, we provide developers with the tools to try out many approaches in an inexpensive way. This approach can only work in an environment where the cost of change is low, in stark contrast to the high re-tooling costs found in the typical industrial process.

Written as a collaboration between a professor of technology and a professor of drama, this book is an eye opening look at the parallels between theatrical production and software development, and a must read for anyone interested in why agile works.
