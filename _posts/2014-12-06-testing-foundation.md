After playing around with a few variations of the theme for this blog and not being entirely satisfied with it, I decided to try something completely different and switched to [Zurb Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/index.html) for my css framework. This is something I have been meaning to try for a while, as I would like some experience of non-Bootstrap frameworks.

I found the switch relatively painless after a quick search provided me with a Jekyll installation pre-configured to use Foundation 5. I cloned the repo and merged it in with my current site on a branch. After an hour or two of sorting out differences in the templates, I had a mostly working blog with a new clean theme. A side bonus was that I also had an atom feed included in the new template, something I was missing in my first attempt and had been meaning to include.

I am still learning the intricacies of Foundation5, but so far I am impressed with the clean semantic css and the ease of customising it. I may try Foundation 5 on a non-trivial Rails project at some point to see if it is as pleasant to work with on larger projects as it is on my simple blog.
